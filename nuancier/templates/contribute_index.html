    href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a></span>
    unless otherwise specified. Note that all contributions must have an <a
    href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Good_Licenses_3">approved
    license</a>.
  </li>
</ul>



<h3>Subject matter</h3>

<p>
  You are free to submit wallpaper covering a wide range of subjects. Not any
  subject though.
</p>

<p>Subject should not contain any:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    brand or trademark of any kind
  </li>
  <li>
    inappropriate material, offensive, indecent, obscene, hateful, tortuous,
    defamatory, slanderous or libelous.
    <ul>
      <li>no sexually explicit or provocative subject matter</li>
      <li>no images of weapons or violent imagery</li>
      <li>no alcohol, smoking, or drug use imagery</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    promotion of bigotry, racism, hatred or harm against any group or
    individual or promotes discrimination based on race, gender, religion,
    nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.
  </li>
  <li>
    unlawful material, in violation of, or contrary to, the laws or
    regulations in the jurisdiction where the work is created.
  </li>
  <li>
    religious, political, or nationalist imagery (including flags)
  </li>
  <li>
    images of hats, particularly fedoras. <span class="small italic">(This is a
    matter of respect for our primary sponsor, Red Hat, Inc., and is not
    negotiable. Of course, passive appearance of hats, such as those upon
    heads in a crowd, may be allowed.)</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    version numbers. <span class="small italic">End users might prefer to
    continue to use an older theme, or use the latest theme in their older
    version of Fedora</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    text. <span class="small italic">The artwork is intended for a global
    audience and text prevent it from being reused by derivative
    distributions</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    identifiable people (contemporary, historical, or fictional).
  </li>
  <li>
    pets or captive or mistreated animals.
  </li>
</ul>



<h3>Technical requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="bold">16:9 ratio</span> is recommended, if possible
    <span class="bold">2560x1440</span> but the bigger the better
    (Yoda agrees when it's about wallpapers).
  </li>
  <li>
    Format should be readable by standard tools. Preferred formats are:
    <span class="bold">SVG and PNG.</span>
    <span class="small italic">Master files, which may be further edited,
    should be maintained in non-lossy formats. Preserving vector graphics,
    raster layers, and channels is important for such materials. </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold">Minimal resolution is 1600x1200</span> that is 1600
    pixels wide by 1200 pixels high but again, the larger the better.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="bold">No watermarks, signatures, photographer/creator names,
    or messages</span> in any part of the work.
    <span class="small italic">However if the license allows, and the photo is
    compelling enough, we could remove watermarks.</span>
  </li>
</ul>



<h3>Composition</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Should strive for subtlety and poetry
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid <a href="http://forensicphotoshop.blogspot.com/2009/04/low-frequency-vs-high-frequency.html"
    >high frequency images</a>.
    <span class="small italic">A soft focus is one way to achieve this </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    As the name suggests, visually, it should settle into the "background"
    of the activity scene.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fewer details on left side allows for good readability for primary
    icons on the desktop.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep in mind that many users have icons covering the entire desktop
        view.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not compete for the user's attention
  </li>
</ul>
